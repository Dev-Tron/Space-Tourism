## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about the importance of a mobile-first workflow in this project. Did alot of work with positioning properties at destop levels. I also further refined my displaying of divs according to their parent elements. I am now more efficient with the flex display property. I also spent alot of time getting my routes to finally match and render in browsers. Safe to say my techniques will go far thanks to this project.

### Continued development

Would like start learning full-stack applications for further development of learning.
